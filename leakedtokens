Good morning
If you are reading this message, it means that I somehow got access to your bot's token

There are many kinds of people in this world
I decided to invalidate this token so that no one uses it for improper purposes

Even if someone helps you with something, NEVER give your bot token to strangers
I could just take your token and put in risk you and everybody that is in server wich bot
I did not do that

Bot tokens are sensitive credentials that should be kept confidential to ensure the security of your bot and the data it handles.
If a bot token is leaked or shared publicly, it can be used by unauthorized individuals to access or control your bot, potentially leading to security breaches or unauthorized actions.

To protect your bot and maintain its security, it's crucial to keep your bot tokens private and avoid sharing them publicly.
If you suspect that your bot token has been leaked or compromised, you should immediately revoke the token and generate a new one.
Additionally, it's recommended to implement strong security measures, such as access control and encryption, to safeguard your bot and its data.

I'm sorry for the problem, I'm doing it for your safety and learning how to stay safe
